If your existing migrations are all autogenerated, you may find it easier to upgrade by deleting all of them and run with the PocketBase v0.23.0 executable ./pocketbase migrate collections which will create a full snapshot of your latest collections configuration.

Optionally, after that you can also run ./pocketbase migrate history-sync to remove the deleted migrations from the applied migrations history.
